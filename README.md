# SimpleGUI
 JAVA SwingGUI Application

SimpleGUI is a simple Java Application that i made to learn more about the Swing API. Very fun to use.

# Things in the Application:

```Discord LookUP tool (sending to discord webhook/copying to clipboard)```
```TODO-List  with option to add Task/Remove Task```
soon more.

This is not recommended to use. Its just a fun Project so I can learn more.
